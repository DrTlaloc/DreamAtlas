I've always loved fantasy, and a major part of fantasy for me is elaborate maps, epic mountain ranges, rivers and so on. I also love competition and multiplayer strategy games. Dominions has never really unified these for me, most maps are either focused on nice geography or good balance (or neither in vanilla's case), so I decided to make my own map generator to make the kind of maps I'd like to play on. This meant going to the drawing board and really asking what makes a good dominions map and then, what maths do you need to accomplish that?
